        <b>About my tablet arriving</b>
        <p>
            My tablet (Surface Pro 8) arrived. Weirdly enough, it had Windows 7 installed on it. I touched the screen a
            bit. When I put it to sleep, it was creating weird artifacts, as if there was something wrong with the GPU.
            I was going to install Linux on it, just like how I am gonna do in real life, but I was worried about the
            GPU problems and the warranty. I was just confused in general.

        <b>Walk in an insecure neighborhood</b>
        <p>
            I was in a relatively insecure neighborhood of Istanbul. There was a mall that had a pool right in the
            middle. The pool was full of fade cut weirdos with pocket knives and whatnot (Turkish gopniks, they are
            called "keko"). I got out of the pool while thinking, "There sure is a lot of piss in this pool". I was
            walking to the tram with a lot of kekos staring at me as if they were about to attack me. (My friend, E,
            started walking with me here; he just appeared out of nowhere).
        </p>
        <p>
            It was very unpleasant, but we arrived at the tram station safely. The tram was like a mixture of a train
            and a ferry. It had a train body with a ferry deck around it. One keko followed us to the tram station and
            asked if we were going to ride this train; he then boarded the same train after us. We felt disturbed there,
            and then we went out on the deck to get some fresh air. Keko followed us to the deck. I talked with E, and
            we got off the train at the next station. The keko disappeared into the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we were walking out of the tram station, there were still a lot of kekos around. I called mom "mom...
            there are so many... around here... danger mom.. it's dangerous here...". A keko heard me and pulled out a
            sword and a gun. He was showing these to me with a grin on his face, but like, the sword was just hanging
            out of its scabbard, and he was holding the gun in his palm like a coin, not holding the grip. Regardless, I
            got scared, I started screaming to my mom, "mom please help me mom take me send someone I want home mom".
            But my mom was continuously telling me stuff like, "oh it's not a big deal just walk home it's safe no
            problem what could happen it's fine". We walked away from the guy, still very nervous. The end

        <b>About elevators in a modern art exibit</b>
        <p>
            I was in a modern art exhibit. I don't know who was with me, but it was somebody who didn't understand
            modern art (tbf, I don't either). The gallery was inside a university. The university was a futuristic
            structure with white, curly, arched columns. The gallery was small, only one room with paintings, and the
            following two rooms that contained mockups of objects in the paintings, crafted by the students. We wandered
            in the rooms for some time, and then we said, "Let's get out, there is nothing here".
        </p>
        <p>
            We went to the elevator to find out that it was 20 liras to use it. I said, "Holy crap, why is the elevator
            paid?". The guy paid for it, but he just threw the money on the ground, and the money disappeared. The
            elevator was similar to that in the book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". It started going down really
            fast, I felt myself getting lighter, but it was still not enough to lift me off the floor (around 7m/s2?).
            When we reached ground level, the elevator slowed down pretty softly despite its bone-shaking speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, just like the book, the elevator started moving horizontally, hovering over a dedicated gray concrete
            road similar to bus rapid transit lanes. The road bent to form a ramp and threw us in the air. We landed on
            water, some yellow floats inflated on the sides of the elevator, and it kept going. There were parts of the
            road made out of concrete (leveled with water). The elevator passed these patches by switching between tires
            and water gear. I told myself, "Whoa, the 20 liras were so worth it."

                I was going to the cinema. Asked my math teacher if he wanted to take the students and come with me to
                "watch a rapidly changing array of pictures". The dream morphed into a forum page where, in a thread,
                people were discussing cinema using weird, non-standard terminology.

                Something about submarines. Somebody was trying to go down, and I was preparing them and telling them to
                be careful. Very interesting, I wish I remembered the whole dream

                Beer was expensive in the art gallery. I went outside to a market, checked the prices, and went back in
                without buying anything

        <b>Posession, ghosts and spooky religion stuff</b>
        <p>
            I was in the sea, on a medium-sized, modern, plastic-metal boat with my family. Suddenly, we started talking
            about magic, spells, and invisible creatures. There was a notepad with small beads on it, which moved with
            the words, and another one with small, yellow-spotted, black bugs constantly spawning on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember not feeling good, as the dream progressed, I started feeling more and more miserable. Then I
            started seeing hallucinations (yes, in a dream, very ironic). Hallucinations happened when I closed my eyes,
            it felt like as if I was falling into something, as if I was possessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            My father told me a lot of people were experiencing these symptoms regularly in elevators a few years ago,
            and they were caused by the notepads. Notepads were placed in elevators by followers to lure people into
            cults. Then I cleaned some sand off myself on the seaside and got out of the sea.
